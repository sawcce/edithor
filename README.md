# Edithor

Edithor is a terminal text editor built from the ground up in c using native APIs.
This was started as a project for me to learn c and improve my skills.

# Current status

Edithor is still in its early stages, thus only the windows implementation of the hal is being worked on right now.
All other features should work normally due to the way the project is structured so feel free to open a PR to add linux support!
